1. Most of the parts were splited into turnable features. So it can be used with more flexible pricing. But all that will have to be done by you
2. Instance now also contains all the fields required to implementet third party SMS plugin. This kinda plugin was implemented for one of the clients. So sorry - no source code this time. But you have all the required info in instance itself.
3. Now you can have custom update queries after main database creation script in 
instanceoverride/design/instanceoverridetheme/db_post_update/db.default.sql
Just rename this file to db.sql
And SQL queries for this file will be after main install.
4. From now all changes you want to do should go directly to
instanceoverride
instancecustomeroverride
